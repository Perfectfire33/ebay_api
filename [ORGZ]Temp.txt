TonicHerb Purposes
If you were curious, here are the rest of the tonics/herbs/things I have accumulated on my desk over the past few months:
```
--ItemName-------------|-------ItemType-------------------|------ItemPurpose---------------------------------|
>Detoxadine             Nascent Iodine                          Replace heavy metals with iodine instead & anti-free radicals

>HopsXFactor            Hops Extract                            Energy & Wellness
>SilverFuzion           Silver in Water                         Immune System Booster
>Cellfuzion             Wild Herb Mix                           Longevity & Antioxydant
>Neurofuzion            Wild Herb Mix                           Mental Focus & Happiness Booster
>RhodiolaRosea          Siberian 3%/1% extract                  Metal Focus & Wellness
>Floratrex              Probiotic                               Digestive System Support
>Indole-3-Carbinol      Cruciferous vegetables extract          Anticarcinogenic, Antioxidant, Anti-atherogenic
```
There are a few other ones I have at home, such as Living Silica, that I haven't tried yet (nor HopsXFactor or SilverFuzion).
I figure over these next few months I'll have narrowed down the top 2-3 to stick to. Really, you don't want too much of anything--even antioxidants.

Questions to ask when renewing lease:
1| What if I change my mind?
2| What about a 3 or 6 month lease? How much would I pay then?
3| Is it alright to pay the monthly rent if I leave early, or might I have to find a subleaser?

What does remote work look like in this organization?

What are the expectations?

How “plugged in” do employees have to be? 
        Are email and IM responses expected in seconds, minutes or hours? 
                (Typically, managers would expect you to respond immediately — in about the same time it would take for them to walk to your desk.)
How is activity and productivity measured?
What mistakes have others made?
What are your success stories?
Who will pay for any necessary equipment or technology?

:List of specific things to tell in interview
------------------------------------------------
>Learned a lot from team lead who works remotely in Chicago; working remotely, etc...
>Essentially worked in a remote-like environment: team lead in chicago, UI devs in raleigh, NC, backend devs work in separate building



While you are not in the presence of family, friends, or acquantiances, assume they are dead. Then, when you see them next, you will be excited to see them!


: NOTES
------------------------------------------------
>New mentality of full control of week
>Might require fixed 'office hours'
>Either way, control food 100%

Q. How do you use TestLodge?

A. We’ve actually expanded our use of TestLodge within the last year. 
Our general work flow is when the product team finishes work on something, we have them use the requirements section in 
TestLodge to give us a description of what the new functionality is, what things should happen, what things shouldn’t happen, and that kind of thing.
They (product) will then create a card in Trello pointing to the requirements in TestLodge and that sort of kicks off the testing process for us.
 The product team will also include any miscellaneous information we might need to know such as what staging environment the feature is in etc. 
 We’ll then take those requirements and turn them into one or more test cases per requirement and we’ll execute the test runs from there.
Once we finish our test runs, we’ll link back to the test report in TestLodge showing any failed, skipped, and passed tests. 
We also use the Github/TestLodge integration because we use Github for issue tracking.
 So anytime a test case fails, it automatically creates an issue in Github for our development team to look at.

Ahh, a bit coin pool! Now I see. Of course! It would just a matter of time before people had to team up. 
I *almost* invested in video cards. Then ASIC hardware. But joining a pool like BitClub Network makes way more sense nowdays :D

Wow, they dynamically invest into other cryptocurrencies, depending on current value. That's awesome!


BitClub Network         http://bitclub.network/starship1547
$99 entry fee

1 = $500  USD   1 share         1000 (600 now) days of mining       50% of all profits paid on daily basis          50% used to help you purchase additional shares in this mine
2 = $1000       1               1000 (600 now)                      60%                                             40%
3 = $2000       1               1000 (600 now)                      70%                                             30%

Each share will pay profits for total of 1000 days before it expires
After shares expire, may renew for another 1000 days


Bitcoin's acceptance is increasing; you can buy a lot of things with bitcoin nowdays -- and also, indirectly using a service like eGifter (buy gift card for typical retail outlets using bitcoin). ATM machines are cropping up in Indy and Detroit in the past 2 years (plus everywhere else). Governments are adopting their own cryptocurrencies as well. So the outlook for cryptocurrencies is generally positive I think.

Bitcoin will have a scalability issue under the current protocol... primarily, it can handle about 6 transactions per second (TPS). Right now we're at about 3 TPS / ~250,000 transactions/day. If it grows at the current rate, we'll hit our limit by end of 2016. So a solution is necessary... and some proposals requires making of centralized data -- trusting others to store the transaction logs for us (instead of downloading it on each client... I think the log is like 20 GB right now, and will grow too big for local PCs before long).

So it depends on the solution. The protocol itself is solid, but the people's implementation of it may make it unsecure. And as always, you'll have to put your trust in the business providing the bitcoin apps, services (wallets), etc... which might not be secure.




Hmm, what did you mean by, "The block chain will be splitting again this year and the price is going to skyrocket"? I think I remember hearing about this before. But it's been a while.



It's free to start a coin base account it takes a couple days to get verified so you
 can make instant transactions I'd start an account and link stuff asap if you think you want to get into it.

MONTHLY_EXPENSES (estimated total): $495(food)+$341(car)+$1109(home)+$515(loans)+$200(Misc)=$2660
MONTHLY_INCOME = $1772.51*2 = $3545 + (132.50*2)
MONTHLY_OUTCOME = +$885

1,897

3545+265= $3,810

999

        50              /       20      /       30
I am 40% (home+car) / 15% (loans) / 14% (food) / 31% (misc)
40.1% = 1,450/3545(home1109+car341)
14.5% = 515(loans515)   
13.9% = (food495)
31.5% = misc

495/3545        = 14%
341/3545        = 10%
1109/3545       = 31%
515/3545        = 15%
200/3545        = 6%
profit          = 24%

Yeah, it made me look at my budget and do some math :D
food       = 14%
car        = 10%
home       = 31%
loans      = 15%
misc       = 6%
profit     = 24%
so I'm like at 48 / 15 / 13 / 24
7+10+31=48% fixed cost;
15% financial goals;
7+6=13% flexible spending;
24% profit;

Hell, you don't even have to do anything, you just have to TALK about issue that affect everyone more often than bullshit issues that affect one celebrity. Once awareness gets around for a particular topic, people actually start DOING something about it.

Right now, people don't give any fucks. And it is really not cool. Because normally I don't care: you do what you do, I do what I do. 
But the fact is, some of this important stuff affects me as well as you. So now I technically start to care about what you do.

Yes, and your opinion is valuable for getting to the bottom of this

Maybe it is worth explaining
It is definately worth explaining
how I got to this conclusion - 



1| I suppose I am quoting Jesse Ventura -- I don't know much about him. Either way, it is the quote itself that matters to me--not who.
The argument is logical in my opinion, which I'm basing on many documentaries, articles, and discussions over the past year.

2| If soldiers begin interacting with U.S. citizens, it will most likely be because it has become their duty to uphold the law. Not because they are working for corporations.
It seems that people will nearly always refuse to execute orders deemed dishonorable. In some cases, service members left the military.
It's just that it is not cool when U.S. officials are blackmailed into doing things they don't want to do, or become adjusted to strong outside influences--as some videos I've seen suggest.

3| An issue I see is the increasing number of activities that are becoming unlawful. So, as time progresses, the population becomes adjusted to once-controversial laws.
Of course service members aren't robots trying to oppress the people! That would be ridiculous, for they are the people too. 
I believe they are to defend the constitution from those who seek to undermine it. 
However, in recent times, most of those who seek to undermine it are not enemy nations (well, maybe we do have more enemies, now that we've invaded several countries), but are the very largest of corporations.

These corporations don't directly undermine the constitution: they do it primarily through lobbists and the Federal Reserve System.
There is an incentive to propagate war because it stimulates the economy, and history appears to show this.
There is evidence that some have taken advantage of this incentive over the past century and that the U.S. is actively participating in war for purposes that do not benefit the common good of all.

So, this is why I say convincing the 99% to follow the orders of the 1% is going to be hard because we're all already doing that by, for the most part, participating in the federal reserve system.

Really, the best part is that the military is made up of the 99%. Thus, it is not the 1% that can truly enforce what we decide to improve upon and change as a society.

4| Yes! I appreciate your concerned reply. I am curious to see what others think, and it seems that being provocative would help with that goal :) 
There is a lot of content on the internet that suggests a wide variety of corruption exists to varying degrees.
After seeing countless interviews and video footage in documentaries, it is becoming very hard for me believe things are truly the way they've always seemed.

Unfortunately, by discussing the negative consequences of the meat industry (and thus disrupting profits) you will be found guilty in a court, according to precedence. 
This is why you don't see any articles talking about the industry on conservation websites, such as Greenpeace.org.
See "Cowspiracy" on Netflix (actually, all of these http://mariamarlowe.com/2015/11/10-best-food-documentaries-netflix/ are pretty good!). 

So I am starting to find my rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are no longer a priority in this country -- but instead, profits for the big guys.





, as this society is no longer making decisions that benefit the common good of all -- but profits for the big guys.


if the law will stay on the side of big industry. 




that everything is what I've been led to believe growing up.





And -- if they are fake -- then there must be some great incentive to make this eloborate of a hoax.




Maybe next time I will instead ask a provocative question and see what happens. 




The 1% using military force on you and I is a long shot, but with enough conditioning it is possible. Corporations inherently value profit over people, so hand them (indirectly) the power to




For my words were hopefully provocotive -- it 

 I think there is a lack of military training for police, so 



 So the 1% doesn't have any *true* power.


deregulation


And it seems that a lot of people are willing to give u




From my research, I have concluded that U.S. officials have promoted the economy several times by using illogical military actions.



There are many economic

Unfortunately, 




It appears that many politicans seek to undermine the constitution for financial reasons.

Correct. The fact that they are independent is the corrupt part -- these Senate Banking Committee members don't even understand what is going on.

**********************************************************************
***** TAKE CARE: YOU ARE PARTICIPATING IN A FRAUD *****
**********************************************************************

From Wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System ):
"
The Federal Reserve System considers itself 
"an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions 
do not have to be approved by the President 
or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, 
it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress, 
and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms."
"

Note the importance of this sentence and be sure to understand that:
1| This is the DEFINITION of the Federal Reserve as CREATED by the Federal Reserve ITSELF!
2| It is an independent central bank
3| U.S. government has NO CONTROL over this bank
4| Thus, U.S. citizens may NOT control who CONTROLS the Federal Reserve

Americans have ZERO control over their life, because everything they depend on requires using a system that they technically cannot control.

By participating in the Federal Reserve System, you forfeit all rights except those granted by the entity. 
It is no different than having to follow the rules at your job: 
Don't want to show up at exactly 9:00 AM? You're fired.

Don't want to pay a tax on income because the IRS cannot report back where the money is spent?
You're going to jail.

The founding fathers hated the idea of a central bank for these reasons.
Big business pushed for a U.S. central bank. They first failed in the late 1800s, and finally succeeded in 1913 by creating The Federal Reserve.
Now, realize that:

5| This bank LOANS the U.S. government money that it CREATES with INTEREST
6| Thus, it is IMPOSSIBLE to pay the interest back because the money DOES NOT EXIST - only the principal was CREATED
6| This bank is allowed to create AS MUCH MONEY AS IT WANTS
7| This bank CONTROLS whether the economy is a depression or a recession by using interest rates
8| Those who run the Federal Reserve use war to increase dependence on the U.S. dollar

This is why the U.S.A has been participating in a fraud since 1913.

Hitler was able to execute the Holocaust. Executing a subtle fraud through corrupt politics in 1913 is a far simpler thing to do, I believe. 
It was brilliantly designed (although, the designers had plenty of examples to work off of), as it propagated itself over a century -- only being finally revealed to the masses because of the internet.

Unfortunately, the physical and emotional damage it has done -- including the several wars (including the Holocaust) -- far outweighs even a thousand Hitlers.

As we move forward
Anytime you come closer to something
Your vision should get clearer
Am I right?
You are a tool in the hidden hand that is using you
Please don't be delusional
The rulers of this world practice confusion 
The people and the priests and the imams
have been jammed by government scams
Minds systematically programmed
Blantant black hatred and racism
The way they lace the whole world and nation with 
traces of satanism
This place is a pagan prison
The founding fathers enslaving intentions were no different than Bush's and Reagan's vision

1776 it took action
This Illumnati took form and was born from a Columbian faction
Just flip your one dollar bill over
and if you want me to expose the true code of deception
I will show you

We live in a designed wicked system
The number 13 is consistent in masonic symbolism
it represents transformation
twelve completes the cycle so the thirteenth is rebirth and regeneration
The meaning of the symbol are strategically here
On the left side you see a thirtheen-legged pyramid
Over that is the all seeing eye where the light shines
The sign of the devil watching over you at all times
The words Annuit Coeptis thirteen letters
Meaning he has favored our undertaking
Will you accept this?
Or will you learn the science and ignore them

Under the pyramid you see Novus Ordo Seclorum
Translated "NEW ORDER OF THE WORLD"
of the new world order
Authors are satanic fathers of mass slaughter
The eagle that you see on the right sits below thirteen stars
with a shield that has thirteen stripes
and an olive branch in its claws with thirteen leafs 
which is supposed to be in its talon to represent peace
but peace was always on a decrease
his other claw holds thirteen arrows of war
set to be released
in the letters at the bottom of the pyramid are fixed
with the Roman Numerals that equal 1776

The United States of America exists
in the deep devilish abyss
with truth and paganism mixed
every president that ever lived was foul
they gather at Bohemian grove where they bow down before the owl

See the owl is wise and can see through the darkness of night
And ever small on the dollar bill on the top right
It ain't hard to understand this government was never for us

The eagle was based off of the Egyptian hawk Horus
The thirteen colonies who went through wicked soverignty
And made no apology of the obvious idology

Subconsciously, we follow the ways of the beast
and pay homage to pagan gods when we say days of the week
like Sunday, they worship the sun
Monday is Moonday
Ten the god of war was worshipped on Tuesday
Odin the chief god is what Wednesday is named for
Thursday is Thor's day, the god of thunder The Mighty Thor
Friday was named after Frigga, notice the pattern?
Saturday is the roman god of Agriculture, Saturn
Frigga was the goddess of love, the wife of Odin

The polythestic theologies needed decoding
the rituals, like trips across the sand this man takes
the skull and bones fraternity
the secret handshakes

But Understand
He who sees only thirty three degrees
He secretely believes in luicifer
and other deities
many powerful and rich people are controlled by these
they even hold a show of their favorite MC's
Politicians tend to lie, tounges riddled with thorns
and use hand gestures shaped in the form of devil horns
you don't fear this, any harm, because you don't know what it entails
satan saves time with stem cells and sprays chemtrails

the so-called holidays are hypocrisy
established to use religious doctrines to commit annual robbery
Christmas split in half is Christ Mass
the so-called birth of Jesus where every home has glowing lights cast
Chjrist the anointed one had birth celebration 
but Jesus' birth was kept secret due to the situation
the King initiated a death plot 
because the messiah was prophesied to rule so Jesus' murder was authorized
No one knows the actual date
That's why some times you see Xmas
Xmas is unknown but ignorance affects us

A fraud that was purposefully flawed
December 25th The birthday of the wicked ruler Nimrod
This whole disguise is part of satan's universal lies
A holy prophet's life being pimped and commercialized
It's ridiculous like lights on trees
Who did I see in Council in 325 AD

By Constantine these matters would decree
The concept of a virgin birth was actually conceived
and then agreed
with graven images in the temple
the fish on your car is called odis of Babylon symbol
it's visibilly contractdictry 
telling your children lies 
you need to study santa clause and this sick history
but we go where ever satan leads us
the falsehoods we practice in his name 
got nothing to do with Jesus

Breaking down replies in order of appearance:

1| @[Michael Paul Ireson] Yes! These are the best kind of discussions :D
Funny, that's exactly what I do as a quality engineer as well! Coincidence? I think not!

Example: A friend yesterday was asking me about being happy. So I offered the idea of working backwards to troubleshoot --
"
I see -- well, yes, you should do what makes you happy. 

But first you must ask yourself what *really* makes you happy -
maybe like, what would you do if you had unlimited money?

Then, work backwards to where you are now. 
How do you see yourself making the transition?

What do you need to do -- what are top priorities #1-10? I imagine #1 might be mind, #2 could be health, #3 may be 

breaking even with money, #4 relationships, etc..?

It's like solving a maze backwards: for some reason, it's easier and gives a great perspective :D
"

2| Yes, that song by Tool is perfect for this discussion :) In fact, MANY songs are perfect for this discussion -- depending on how far down the rabbit hole you go!

I interpret one (of potentially many) message of this song as saying that, although God gave us the tools necessary to live successfully, we may easily choose not to use them.
And we do just that! We defy logic on a daily basis, sacrificing truth for the instant gratification that believing in the lies grants us.

Woah... I might have gone a bit too far down the rabbit hole for the present moment, right there!



3| @[Kristen Welk] Based on the history I have reviewed, the 'funny balance' you speak of is designed and maintained by some of the most powerful families in the world.

"We're radicalizing these groups, arming them" <--10000% agree!! This paragraph summarizes a core issue perfectly.
"War is profit. Profit is power."  Oh, I guess you already know all this! Very cool :D


4| @[Lisa Leger] It definitely sounds like you guys were on top of things back in the late 60's/early 70s!
You're totally right: it is actually, unfortunately, truly, time to... how can I say this succinctly?
LIVE FREE OR DIE
In other words, we literally have to DO SOMETHING and SOON.
There is a lot more I'd like to say, but time is slipping away today!
It is awesome to have your perspective from time in history. The population control strategies are, unfortunately, just as real as the Holocaust and other things you thought made no sense.

Human population itself is not the problem. It is how we live as a population --
One big error: consuming the amount of meat and dairy we do today.
According to Cowspiracy, we have 70,000,000,000 cattle on this planet who EACH eat 250x the amount of food a human eats EVERY DAY.
The amount of methane they emit is insane compared to carbon emissions. Global climate change is REAL and fossil fuels are maybe 30% of the cause.
Watch Cowspiracy for more info. Or ask me.

What we communicate now may soon become extremely dangerous.
The laws are now set in place.
They're selecting words and judging based on words.
If they judge you as a t3rr0r1$t, you don't get to go to c0urt.
You go directly to ja1l and do not pass go.

Right now, it is mostly c3ns0rsh1p by Facebook and YouTube, 
but don't be surprised if weird things start happening to you--if you are discovered to having knowledge of particular information--as others have reported.

So it is best to get the message out now,
prepare, and leave, while the leaving is good.

Being l0ck3d up in a F3M4 c4mp is NOT a good idea!

Unfortunately... the entire planet is under attack.
But, surprisingly, there is still a glimmer of chance!


5| @[All] We'll have to setup a real, more protected way to chat to truly discuss these matters if any real difference is to be made. 
I have ideas in mind, and will let you and friends know if and when it becomes a thing.

Also, I should have some of my own compiled documentation within the next few months to back up any claims I have made in the past or will claim in the future.
Currently, my documentation is a bunch of text files, youtube videos, Netflix documentaries, websites, and events.
So I will share it when it is ready :)
 >>>>
 
 
Yeah, so the best thing to do is just say, "okay... cool, that sucks, yeah, but we have a problem and we need to find a solution that works in the best interest of everyone"

The USA is now a p0l1ce st4t3, as of a couple weeks ago -- 
Anything you communicate that the N$4 collects can now be used against you in court (if you get your chance to go to a c0urt):
http://humansarefree.com/2016/03/its-official-nsa-data-will-be-used-for.html
Combined with ND44, they can lock up people quickly because it seems like they could bypass courts with N$4 evidence. So that is why I say "if you get your chance to go to a c0urt":
*******************************************

A couple (super quick) Google searches revealed about a 50/50 chance that these verses are correct (e.g. it felt that, in forums, 50% of people 100% diagreed with each other).

The deception is real :) I have yet to do a real investigation into this topic, but this post got me thinking about it.

So I figured it was important to share / bookmark it, so I could come back and take a closer look when I had time.

After reading news like this: http://www.networkworld.com/article/2228920/microsoft-subnet/ridiculous-dhs-list--you-might-be-a-domestic-terrorist-if---.html

I am now curious, why is DHS involving religion (if that article is true)? Why, then, would it be congruent with the shared post (especially the top part)?

This is a huge topic. Regardless of the validity of the content, the fact that it exists in the first place has major implications.




My theory thus far at least about Mu$l1m$, is that most Mu$l1m$ follow an older version of the K0r4n, which advocates peace and harmony. 
Some people corrupted parts of the K0ra|\| and shared it with others, thus convincing them of all the things mentioned in the shared post.
Now the world is littered with lies!

Connecting that to the the tip of the iceberg of the rest of my research....

The other week I stumbled upon 
http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666
http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/AllDemons.html
The fact that it directly contradicts generally everything about Chr1st14nty raised a huge red flag.
I had previously learned of an account where an alien abduction was cancelled upon the abductee yelling "Jesus Christ"
That, combined with other research that showed that al13ns are more extra-d1m3n$10n4l beings, rather than extra-terr3str1al beings, opens up the possibility that al1en$ are v4rying degree$ of dem0ns and ang3ls.

I have started doing research into the stories in the B1b|_3 and J4$u$, and it points towards the creation of the |\| \/\/ 0 will mark the beginning of the tr1bu|_4t1on period.

I can say the 3l1t3s would like to have the N3W W0RLD O4RD3R set up by 2020, and in full effect by 2030.
http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/could-language-barrier-actually-fall-within-next-10-years
The language barrier may disappear, causing a repeat of history.
These dates and times are following prophesy, which is validated by itself via time--thus the proof is essentially in the pudding.

It is hidden well in plain sight, especially if you're neck deep into popular culture. When you begin to start looking into it and connecting the dots, it is actually fairly straightforward.
I have a lot of research I need to put together, and it will take some time. 







But, in the mean time, this is my theory thus far. 


Based on what I've seen, the chance of this being correct in *some variation* (lots of verification needed still) is extremely high (95%).

 Extremist are easy to spot but they all worship from the same book with the same laws??? Is anybody paying attention???
:>>>>>
 Is anybody paying attention??? ---------> War uprising chaos in middle east
 --> Extremists follow book literally --> if more follow book --> chaos
 --> order out of chaos --> NWO
 --> new religion: Shariah / hybrid --> source of inspired terrorism is clostest to jersuleum, what satan would want to destroy homeland of Jesus
 --> 




Oh wow, I believe here lies a critical piece of the puzzle. Hard to believe at first, but not very so after all seeing the evidence I've stumbled upon thus far.



Act smart, stay alert!




 My recent research has revealed that words like 

%_PUZZLE_PIECES_%
Bibles commonly(?) won't burn in fires.
Aliens run away upon hearing Jesus Christ.


As a side note, I would say these are the end times, as prophesied. Whether I believe it or not, the proof is in the pudding, and ignoring that doesn't make logical sense.


Listen up...not my words but ??



How long are we going to sit by and watch the horrible atrocities happening in Europe, Africa, Belgium, France and soon here before we do something? 
The be-headings, rapes, genocide of Christians are becoming more frequent. Once Muslims are the majority in America, all it will take is a democratic vote to intact Shariah
 then it will be the law to kill you if .... for a number of reasons. I'm having trouble distinguishing 
 "peaceful" Muslims and devout Muslims. Extremist are easy to spot but they all worship from the same book with the same laws??? Is anybody paying attention???
I hope everybody reads this and it sinks in! This information has all
been checked, then double checked... it is 100% Correct. That's why
there is such an alarm within US government, since Trump's statement
about temporary suspension of migration of Muslims to US till US
authorities make sure there is a proper concept of safe penetration of US
territory. People are stunned to learn that the head of the U.S. CIA is
a Muslim! Do hope this wakes up some! You mean until it hits you like a
ton of bricks read it again, until you understand! We now have a Muslim
government. John Brennan, current head of the CIA converted to Islam
while stationed in Saudi Arabia. Obama's top adviser, Valerie Jarrett,
is a Muslim who was born in Iran where her parents still live.
Hillary Clinton's top adviser, Huma Abedin is a Muslim, whose mother and
brother are involved in the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
Assistant Secretary for Policy Development for Homeland Security, Arif
Aikhan, is a Muslim. Homeland Security Adviser, Mohammed Elibiary, is a
Muslim.
Obama's adviser and founder of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, Salam
al-Marayati, is a Muslim.
Obama's Sharia Czar, Imam Mohamed Magid, of the Islamic Society of North
America is a Muslim.
Advisory Council on Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships, Eboo Patel, is
a Muslim.
1/13/15:?? Nancy Pelosi announced she will appoint Rep Andre Carson,
D-Ind, as the first Muslim lawmaker on the House of Representatives
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. It would make Carson the
first Muslim to serve on the committee that receives intelligence on the
threat of Islamic militants in the Middle East! He has he suggested that
U.S. schools should be modeled after Islamic madrassas, where education
is based on the Quran!!! And last but not least, our closet Muslim
himself, Barack Hussein Obama. It's questionable if Obama ever
officially took the oath of office when he was sworn in. He didn't repeat
the oath properly to defend our nation and our Constitution. Later the
Democrats claimed he was given the oath again in private.
CIA director John Brennan took his oath on a copy of the Constitution,
not a Bible.??
Valarie Jarret wrote her college thesis on how she wanted to change
America into a Muslim friendly nation and she is a Obama top advisor
Congressman, Keith Ellison took his oath on a copy of the Qur'an.
Congresswoman Michele Bachman was vilified and verbally tarred and
feathered by Democrats when she voiced her concern about Muslims taking
over our government.
Considering all these appointments, it would explain why Obama and his
minions are systematically destroying our nation, supporting radical
Muslim groups worldwide, opening our southern border, and turning a blind
eye to the genocide being perpetrated on Christians all over Africa and
the Middle East. The more damage Obama does, the more arrogant he's
become! Our nation and our government has been infiltrated by people
who want to destroy us. It can only get worse!
If you fail to pass this one on, there's something wrong.. Somewhere!
In his book Obama said,. "if it comes down to it, I would side with the
Muslims".
Common sense doesn't grow in everyone's garden!!
Something to consider. This is why we are in big trouble. Can Muslims be Good Americans?
Can a devout Muslim be an American patriot and a loyal citizen? Consider this:
Theologically? no. Because his allegiance is to Allah, the moon god of Arabia.
Scripturally? no. Because his allegiance is to the five pillars of Islam and the Qur’an.
Geographically, no. Because his allegiance is to Mecca, to which he turns in prayer 5 times a day.
Socially? no. Because his allegiance to Islam forbids him to make friends with Christians or Jews.
Politically? no. Because he must submit to the mullah (spiritual leaders), who teach annihilation of Israel and destruction of America, the great Satan.
Domestically? no, because he is instructed to marry four women and beat and scourge his wife when she disobeys him. (Qur’an 4:34). Can you see a court case brewing here?
Religiously? no. Because no other religion is accepted by his Allah except Islam. (Qur’an, 2:256)
Intellectually? no, because he cannot accept the American Constitution since it is based on Biblical principles and he believes the Bible to be corrupt.
Philosophically? no, because Islam, Muhammad, and the Qur’an do not allow freedom of religion and expression.
Spiritually? no, because when we declare “one nation under God,” the Christian’s God is loving and kind, while Allah is NEVER referred to as our heavenly father, nor is he ever called Love in the Qur’an’s 99 excellent names. Democracy and Islam cannot co-exist.
Every Muslim government is either dictatorial or autocratic. Therefore after much study and deliberation perhaps we should be very suspicious of ALL MUSLIMS in this country. They obviously cannot be both good Muslims and good Americans.
Call it what you wish…it’s still the truth. If you find yourself intellectually in agreement with the above, perhaps you will share this with your friends. The more who understand this, the better it will be for our country. Pass it on. The war is bigger than we know.
To be "All-American”… One must support the Constitution and the principles of our Founding Fathers. There is no room for Sharia Law or supporters of that backwards Islamic system of laws.
There is no such thing as “Peaceful Islam” or “Peaceful Muslims”, They have not progressed into the modern world.
Koran 2:191 "slay the unbelievers wherever you find them"
Koran 3:21 "Muslims must not take the infidels as friends"
Koran 5:33 "Maim and crucify the infidels if they criticize Islam"
Koran 8:12 "Terrorize and behead those who believe in scriptures other than the Koran"
Koran 8:60 " Muslims must muster all weapons to terrorize the infidels"
Koran 8:65 "The unbelievers are stupid, urge all Muslims to fight them"
Koran 9:5 "When the opportunity arises, kill the infidels wherever you find them"
Koran 9:123 "Make war on the infidels living in your neighborhood"
Koran 22:19 "Punish the unbelievers with garments of fire, hooked iron rods, boiling water, melt their skin and bellies"
Koran 47:4 "Do not hanker for peace with the infidels, behead them when you catch them".

1| Identify all features of TCCS
	--> Then we can figure out what all the components are
	--> What technololiges we need
	--> How to proceed from here in CW, and from here in ININ

design GUIs / interface methods --optimize best way

2|Build Charter
3| Build Timeline



1| add tc status column to gimpyUpdater
2| fix gimpyExecuter accordingly to changes in #1
3| Create gimpySyncer to pull from TCDB
	--need to be sure version column is populated to begin with (getVersion)
4| Plan and Create DB
5| Create gimpyTCCSimporter to push from GimpyUpdater to TCCS
6| Create simple PHP script to display TCCS data


--Other Scripts--
A| TC_SET_Converter
	--converts TCs to new format
B| TC_NEW_FORMAT_CONVERTER
	--converts from new format to Excel
C| TC_NEW_FORMAT_Syncer
	--pulls data from TCCS/Gimpy Updater and pushes into TC_NEW_FORMAT*.txt




--------------------
1|select test cases to update or feature suite
2| auto-create an excel file with that latest data in it from TCDB (sync)
3| make updates, and push excel to TCDB and TCCS




---------------------
Existing test set format --> straight to MySQL
Then from MySQL --> Excel

---------------------
Design Excel Sheet:
--sheet2= user-friendly view
--sheet1:
 be able to select test cases based on data in excel
 e.g. be able to target a test exec set and execute it (all test cases in same doc)

PShell: Interface (TestCaseSets <--> Excel or DB?)

Python: 	Interface ( Database <--> TextFile )
Python: Interface ( Excel <--> Database )
Python: Interface ( CustomGUI <--> Database )


excel 2 sheets
	>First Sheet:
		>Current Layout
	>Second Sheet:

!Just map the cells!

>Excel: Many sheets -- different views of test case, seriesXSequence, etc...

Feature Suites???
	>?

JIRA interface??

Confluence Interface?? __> read DB from Confluence, display stats

Can Newman output responses??? If so, maybe that is good for now


Build Curl Calls in Python.
Basically, use testCaseSets layout for each call
And read from Excel
Assemble and then execute the set.
The script saves responses, all sent headers, etc... to nearby folder

Use postman splitter script to save current call info;
Then make a converter in the python script for the javascript tests

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
So, 
a\ we create test cases in the new format
b\ we then use script to push into Excel
c\ we then create TCs using GImpyExporter.py
	--TC data is auto-synced to TCCS
---
a\we update test cases in the new format
	--first select and sync data from TCDB in to the new format files
			--TC data is auto-synced to TCCS
	--then make updates accordingly in the new format
b\ we then use script to push into Excel
c\ we then update TCs using GimpyUpdater.py
	--tc data is auto-synced to TCCS
---
a\ we execute manual sets of UI test cases by running GimpyUI_Executor.py
---
