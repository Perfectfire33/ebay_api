For last 2 commits (and this one) :
voice in head said that now you are not involved in the blue light special (something like that) 4:07 AM 6/17/2020

will resume looking outside for any new clues to what might be going on (not sure: side light going on 3 times + animal making loud rustling noise and running from what looked like Jim Harris house area + reflecting lights on blue door of house next door  seems quite odd + also a voice in my head that indicated a sniper is present and to avoid I must move right (get in Line of Sight [LOS] of TCP/IP camera in house of 26075 clear st.) then left and go in through door -- next to bench in front @ 26075 clear st.). This is second time I hear / feel sniper (the last time was on Easter Sunday of 2019 walking with Kyle down Clear St. in Evening 7PM? EST towards Jefferson)
