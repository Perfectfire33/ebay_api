Thinking outwards versus inwards (is not the same as 'Thinking From The End' (solving a maze is easier from end to start analogy) )

--
Previously, we thought from the inwards (present moment) and it resulted in the outwards (future manifestation)

Woah, so basically, we went from doing it right our whole life, to then 'waking up'  -- which caused losing track and falling off course -- basically start 'doing it wrong'  , and now we're learning how to do it right again??? coolstorybro.

But seriously... this is pretty neat /neatNature

So now we know how to go (in and out) and (out and in).... well, the latter needs practice (what we're currently doing)... but overall, now we know the basics so we can share with others.

What caused us to start thinking in the future (outwards-->now), instead of in the present (now -->outwards)? 
	--Goal setting (02/25/2014 to 03/01/2015)
		++Gave us the idea of future things to do: big objectives -- girlfriend, wife, house, etc...
		++Idea that we'd move back to Michigan after 1-3 years
		++Goals changed as new events happened (see next two major causes) and that dictated our every day actions
	--Many thought shift paradigms (starting 03/01/2015 to 08/22/2016)
		++Learning how real reality and conciousness works
		++Learning what the current state of this universe is in
		++Learning current immediate danger to USA
	--Angie Leaving (starting ~08/30/2015 to 08/01/2016)
		++Caused us to start thinking into past as what went wrong (depressed)
		++Caused us to start thinking into future as to how to fix it (anxiety)

So now we know we need to think from the end but yet keep our mind in the present. Before, we more like had "ideas about what the future will look like" instead of "expectations about what the future will look like".

So we need to not expect anything anymore. Yes, we want to move home. We feel like moving home is the right thing to do. So now that we have decided that, we will focus on doing things that make us come closer to arriving at home. We will not focus on assuming if we look for a job we will find one with X Y and Z attributes. We will know that of course we will make it home, but how or when is not our exact concern, we hold no expectations to this idea. It is just an idea that we will be leaving before Christmas, and it is just an idea (althought that we know will come about in one way or another) that we will end up doing the Michigan things that we have mulled over and felt in our heart.


Bring forth thoughts from the past to use as example templates to follow in order to successfully complete present day goals.
Bring forth thoughts from the past to use as example templates to follow in order to successfully understand what NOT to do.
Refer to thoughts from the date ranges in the above causes for help finding examples for what NOT to do.


So now what do we do? We understand that many other people have this problem. So we should share this eventually.
In meantime, catch self each time thinking in future or past and reset to present task at hand.
Over time, this will become natural once again. 
However, we have far greater experiences now, so will not be exact same as before, but will be far greater!
