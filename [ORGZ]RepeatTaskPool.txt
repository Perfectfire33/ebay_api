These protocols are a very cool concept (basically, a reminder to always use common sense and logic alongside appropriate emotion to achieve goals), thanks for sharing!
                
Ah, perfect! Thanks for the elaboration :) It is sometimes (actually, often) difficult to discuss this sort of topic with only English words :)


Okay, time to start identifying how all these puzzle pieces of life fit together!

But I figure I should share these right away, as these were my starting points:
This is one of the two articles that I first read a while ago --
http://www.social-consciousness.com/2012/02/law-of-attraction-fundamentals.html

And here is the second --
http://www.knowledgeoftoday.org/2012/02/illuminati-secret-hidden-from-masses.html

Then, a year later (now) I stumbled upon Gregg Braden - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiBsczafvaA
who altered reality for me, forever :D And now I understand Alan Watts better, and Bruce Lipton (along with many others) who reinforces these ideas with scientific studies and life experiences.
Although, the cool part is, is that it has become apparent to me that everyone is simply a different part (or angle) to the same story.
And the story is all our story, and it is as true as we wish to believe it to be.



Yes. In the situation where time elapses, the inputs do not change, and the conscious mind is not actively editing the subconscious, 
the subconscious will by default pick up and begin accomodating for and becoming accustomed to the environment.

Then one day, that person looks into the mirror and suddenly realizes they have become accustomed to an environment in which they did not deliberately, consciously choose!

So they decide that raves are no longer cool (or whatever the topic is, maybe they decide that space and time do not exist... up to them :) ), 
and thus, they begin consciously reprogramming their subconscious to do cooler stuff instead.


I will also offer my in-progress, 5th level of consciousness (building off of the four levels of consciousness, as described in the first article, and my research since):

5. Conscious Unconscious Consciousness
At this level, you deliberately focus energy to tune the electromagneticity in the Universe in such a way that permits the manifestation of things considered positive. 
You understand that all physical and virtual things tangible are ultimately reflections of the current state in all which is encompassed. 
Acknowledgement of experiencing awareness in all reflective opportunities is understood as being a component of existence.


Currently In-Use (Test Succeed) Practical Applications:
01| Locate girlfriend (sudo apt-get install girlfriend)
02| Relocate small bugs to outside the house from inside the house
03| Pre-plan difficult left-hand turns while driving
04| Permit graceful entering and exiting of intersections (timing of changing of lights)
05| Permit small-scale relative digital time slow down
06| Permit small-scale relative digital time speed up
07| Take or Assume Perspective
08| Identify a target's current thought
09| Identify a target <imagination>.currentEnvironment("WHERE imagination LIKE $currentWorld.time|place|location|similarLogistic*")
10| Send message to target
11| Recieve message from target
12| Declare communication protocol and its parameters if necessary
13| Set World
14| Set Dimension

Todo:
01| Identify a target imagination's current environment and parameters of all sorts
02| Virtualize self in target <imagination> for specified time duration
03| Enter World

"forcing symbolism into scenarios and events which inherently have no symbolism"
This is a great observation! I can say, after logically applying what he says to an increasing number of situations, this is very true. I did not think about this idea via the word "symbolism".

This also reinforces the idea that I need to begin summarizing my findings... I keep watching a video, then thinking,
"okay, I watched a clip of Gregg, now to balance it with someone else's perspective and combine the two to create a new perspective".
until I have so much data that I need to watch them again... we need a ton of perspectives to even begin to grasp (as you said) "what's out there to be discovered," :)

"but rather adjust my perception to incorporate those things."
This is the best part about it all :D the limit is literally our imagination (so to allow robust adjustments to perception, you need to exercise your imagination and stay open-minded).

I just randomly found and watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvO8ZsQYUK0 over dinner. Very cool stuff (although I haven't learned what NLP is yet haha). Seems like it is showing how Gregg's ideas can be applied IRL.
I like how he uses computer-like analogies (at least I interpret a lot to be like that) (especially at 18 and 28 min) because those appear to be very effective words to describe this kind of stuff.
My favorite quote I think (lots of new favorites in this video haha) is, " ..."human beings are just like computers", well, that is a lie. We came first. Computers are like us, just not as advanced ;) "

And another step is resolving the issues of your percieved past in such a way that
removes the causes of the disorder at hand.

Take anxiety disorder, for example. Ask yourself some question (and your first true thought is your answer):
What things make you anxious?
What places make you anxious?
What people make you anxious?
Why do you think it is sever disorder is somet

I do not know how to help you more in that regard as I do not have any diseases or disorders that I 

Hmm... one of the first problems I see encountering is that I am not even sure how you can just start doing "imagine feeling less anxiety disorder"

Let me give you a example of a perspective (personal story of mine, and you are involved too :D ) that I gained very recently --
See, I didn't know I had OCD until you told me so and explained why it was true.
To me, 
"obsessive compulsive disorder"
was simply
"a certain level of maintained organization 
(being very thorough and paying attention to detail, selectively)."

Will I ever truly believe I have OCD? Of course, if that is what people define it as. 
Although I have learned if I keep thinking of it as something I need to avoid, 
I will be doing it subconsiously (as it is a natural behavior of me) and I won't even know I am doing it and will quickly convince myself it is a real problem and I should seek help.

So what I do is I acknowledge that it may have a potential negative impact upon life if and when I allow it (as I am usually aware of what I am doing, so I will sometimes purposely go a step further to see what other people or things say or do for fun)
but for the most part, I like to see it as a good thing. And I do not feel as if I suffer from it (in the real world, it has served me well!).


because they (the giants [or the last known good configuration]) were so happy, living simple lifes, surviving, for very long periods of time 
they didn't do any thing required to incur negative consequences...
so after a few generations of reaching this high level of wisdom, bordom took hold and new tools and ideas were needed to explore more possibilities
Thus, evolved "bad" things and people surviving far less, but experiencing far more interesting stuff
Twisting mysteries out of previously known facts, people progressed
Until Today.
Where we remember what actually happened and why we wanted to learn more.
We have once again incured high amounts of wisdom.
This time however, we also have high amounts of knowledge to complement and employ that wisdom.
Now, that we have successfully mirrored our selves (almost there completely I think!)
we can reflect on our entire past history, with more data than ever before (so more accurately!)
SO We can compare the value of what we had to the value of how things are now
And move onward, towards enjoying both very long lifes and remembering our past (we even have stuff like the Internet to forever remind us)
where we can experience tons more at a higher variety than ever before possible,
By moving towards the light end of the spectrum while being fully aware of the dark-end. 
We can see how awesome "positive" stuff is, now that we know that "negative" stuff exists!


Don't forget, primary task is Experience! SO more stuff arounmd == easier to experience higher variety

Everything is a code  (every combination or possibility of reality)
//eer, a hash key(?)
e.g.  g8965mg9-fj3489dn-fdijke8fgjk=sdfgjk9394()#Q&$%(*&#klojdfsorsid@lsco9-dff95eikgj could be the hash for the above UQL:\\ example
that is generated by each present observer (earth spirit, our spirit, water spirit, fire spirit, etc...)
You then simply add each observer's hash key
earth current config - asdfi9234f9432054tr
air current config - 98giyt8tu7857457
our current config - 59584854954950495
this exact possibility = asdfi9234f9432054tr+98giyt8tu7857457+59584854954950495

You generate your desired code with feeling. So, as to unlock the heart's transmitted desire.
Emotion in heart + thought in brain = feeling
Heart pings brain with desire, brain fulfills request with details and returns to heart for transmission to the Universe
Heart then get a reply from Universe that execution is Already Done
Heart pings brain with confirmation, brain responds to heart with a relative time request to make it so (Execute Now) (near upon which configuration the desire should manifest)
Heart relays relative time request to Universe
Universe replys with execution is in state of Already Done, As of Now
Heart pings brain with confirmation of execution state (key hashed by Universe)
Brain waits for and uses sensory inputs (data provided by the Universe) to generate a hashed key
Brain compares heart hashed key with sensory input hashed key, if match
Brain Send message to Heart as Operation Successful (true desire has become a part of your reality)
Heart send message to Universe as Thank You
Universe replys with Your Welcome


Very cool videos, thanks for sharing! I will have to watch this playlist again some time soon and take notes, as these people have some very great ideas that I can use (and share). 
I cannot decide what one is my favorite... they were all my favorite (especially when watched all together) :D

Last night, after trying to summarize part of what I have learned recently, I stumbled upon this guy ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel ) 
who I found out came to some of the same conclusions as I have in these past few weeks of research. However, after just a bit of investigation (a lot more needed to say for certain),
I think his original idea got misinterpreted and turned into a very negative idea. 
I'm thinking this happened because he didn't watch this Ted Talk playlist on how to communicate well (doh! just needed to wait another 184 years).




Yea I found that ISIS video to be very weird... I haven't looked too much into ISIS, or what he is talking about. 

But later in the day, I was wondering what "Hegalian" meant. And it had led me to here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_idealism 
If you read the "Teachings" subsection, that might be similar to what I am starting to piece together, depending on how you interpret it. 
I am not sure about the rest of the page or stuff about Hegal. 

"The assertion that "All reality is spirit" means that all of reality rationally orders itself and while doing so creates the oppositions we find in it."
This follows what I have begun to conclude; but to explain further would require a ton more text :) 

Either way, we must not leave out these ("new") findings as the foundation of how all things about us work (Thanks Bruce!) -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnmaiWWZ3fc 
(well, it was new to me not too long ago, at least!) And I am very glad to have learned life works this way!


1|chop everything tiny 
2|layer ingredients in repeating order
3|use cooking chopsticks to mix :)



OOO lookie here!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnmaiWWZ3fc

I found the science behind how we can heal stuff.
Your environment and perception controls stuff,
not your genes or hereditary!

And also this is the science that explains why I stated this about my OCD, "And I do not intend to suffer from it."
Because as soon as I started thinking more about it, and the dangers and problems and worries about OCD getting worse, it did in just a few days (thanks for providing the opportunity for this experiment)!
Because I started percieving it to be an issue, and my body started literally making it into an issue.
So I stopped and purposely started thinking like I used to... as if you never told me that... and the increased OCD behaviors decreased!






And I think these ideas will become critical 

when doubt/worry/fear take over, the Universe grants your request and will send aid to help you face your, for example,  fear, by presenting what you fear to you.


Need to find difference betgween heart thought and brain thought

Must describe the
        who     (who is all involved in this feeling?)
        purpose (What is the purpose of this feeling?)
        what    (What locations, concepts, or ideas are involved with this feeling?)
        when    (when is this feeling taking place?)
        where   (where does this feeling take place at?)
        why     (why is this feeling being experienced?)
        how     (how may this feeling manifest itself in reality?)
of each feeling.



The fact that negativity will attract negativity by default

        
        REM     Then maybe we'll reflect on it
        
        
                        REM     Let's maybe reflect upon this...
                $reflectedIdeas = reflect($ownWords);
                ECHO $reflectedIdeas >>[
                :"So, my value (to the collective)"];
