why did ray say "0.00000023" afteer I was being noisy and saying that in my head as an example of something (e.g. I was sitting on the slab in back near garage door and he was outside at the table (ALdonnas) AL=Al Learst? AL=AmngieLuop AL=ALambana AL=AL? AL=Al Learst and Ray could definitely hear me make audible noise while I thought about "well that has a 0.0000524% chance of happening))

did Ray hear me think ? does Jesus enable telepahthy whjn necessatY?

what is the 'back slab'?

When Kyle was here the evening of Easter of 2019 (I asked Kyle if smoke with me in the backyard so I calm down fro m the ritual and I asked pa if wanted to too. Thought it would be a good time to ask due to the demon attack thinking dad would give it a tryt=truth because something new dad didnt know might be happening , but dad declined) the trailer for the 1981 boat, "Long Shot", was parked on the 'back slab' .
