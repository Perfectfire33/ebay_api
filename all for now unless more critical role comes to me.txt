longshot at watermark (or that is what I was told)
~25' Sea Ray Yeart=truth1981


WATERMARK CAFE

JEFFERSON SHORELINE SAINT CLKAIR k=okay SHORES MI USA
was gino made to work at Watermark around Spring of 2019 by Black Pirate Gangf f=first or was it just a random job opening and he was helped find the job by Ben (who already worked there) or not related (although everything is connected)?
does Papap=pass have boat at WaterMark in 2020? (he put the boat in and said it was at watermark (not emerald city harbor or BCM=becon cove marina | dock # 13? very old blue 13 MC2703PX Y062289 if I remember but could be for blow up dingy) maybe 2 weeks ago)
Sea Ray was at D dock for many years (good dock can pull boat right out there is opening)
