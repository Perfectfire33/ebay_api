Unlike national debt (US Government), the rate of change of stock market (corporations) is not viewed as agreed upon by political decisions--only through regulations that affect companies (this may affect stock price). 

Hiding the 'panic' chart from public view is OK as nobody looks at or talks about long-term charts on a regular basis--they view daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly charts to look at short and mid-term gains. Anyone who suspects that a large decline in the stock market over a short period of time will affect the 'real economy' is seen as 'crazy'.

The stock market may follow the national debt due to the fact that the debt was money borrowed to use in the stock market. Once stocks reach their technical peaks, people will become more likely to withdraw from stocks to pay off their debt as they no longer see a profit in the stock market.

This hurts companies, causes lay offs and unemploymen, people conserve money, and it is not good to have so much invested in something that affects the real economy but is not openly acknowledged that it does so.
