I also recomend organic bone broth and calcium powder made from egg shells to remineralize teeth and avoid dairy as it leaches calcium from teeth and bones.Also STOP drinking fluoridated water and using toothpaste containing fluoride.The fluoride they put in tap water and toothpaste is sodium fluoride,  it is toxic! Our body needs calcium fluoride which we get from vegetables especially kale, egg yolks and fish.Any dentist who insists that sodium fluoride strengthens teeth needs to educate themselves.Sodium fluoride weakens teeth and bones .It is a neurotoxin!?


Gerry Blue I boil the egg shells for around 5 minutes to kill any bacteria then bake in a low oven for around 5 to 10 minutes( careful not to burn them) then I use a coffee grinder to make a very fine powder amd add a little coconut oil to make a paste and use as a toothpaste. Alternatively you can add  the calcium powder (ground egg shells) to food eg smoothies or shakes, juices etc.?


Zafira London  Both powder and paste should be  stored in a glass jar (with lid) in refrigerator. .I store the powder in the refrigerator and make a small amount of toothpaste (usually a week worth) and keep it  in my bathroom. It's a lot more convenient and the coconut oil won't harden as much. If you're going to keep it out of the refrigerator only make a small amount.?
