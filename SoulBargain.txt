What I want from love... (long and specific):

I want to oust all fear between Angie and I,
I want to establish certainty without doubt between Angie and I,
I want to renew sexuality between Angie and I,
I want to be able to continually show Angie true love in person,
I want to be able to always have that infinite energy that true love provides,
I want to be able to be as romantic physically as I am in my mind towards Angie
