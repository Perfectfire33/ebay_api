A strategy at a high level *could* be:
1| Fix nutrition
2| Fix industry
3| Fix government
-----
In a bit more detail:
-----
1a|Determine a simple strategy that will swiftly indoctrinate the people to the ways of true, proper nutrition

1b|People will demand organic vegetables, fruits, seeds, nuts, algae, and other whole foods over processed, dairy and meat products

1c|Industry will naturally succumb to fulfilling the demands of the people (See: Walmart does this already)

1d|Diseases will decline drastically over a short period, significantly reducing the size and control of the pharmaceutical industry

1e|A lot of people will begin to make better decisions if they are not sick
+
+
+
+
2a|People will not tolerate water fluoridation

2b|People will not tolerate amalgam fillings

2c|People will not tolerate toxic chemicals found in household products

2d|The meat, fish, and dairy industries will be significantly reduced in size due to lack of demand of meat, fish, and dairy

2e|"common sense" industries will populate the economic footprint of existing illogical industries
+
+
+
+
3a|New industries will push government to no longer hide true nutrition information, just as many of today's largest industries push government to protect themselves

3b|New industries will undo the injustices done by existing industries

3c|During this transitional time, congress will be replaced by a whole set of awake individuals not persuaded by industries that commit global ecocide and crimes against humanity

3d|New, next-generation thinking is introduced to solve existing crises

3e|Many government agencies that commit crimes against humanity will be dismantled and prevented from reassembling using a next-generation set of protocols

This strategy may be best combined with others... but it is an idea!
The big issue is better nutrition. It is a rough time reducing the amount of daily sugar intake, for example (like quitting cocaine).
Nobody wants to be told what to eat or do. But sometimes, the simplest disciplines (one task: watch what you eat!) will bring about the largest rewards.

In this world, the richest people have a primary goal of staying the richest people. If everyone else acted as a team, the team could manipulate the richest people's actions when it comes to their industrial assets.

People also want power and control. So there will be a need to resolve this issue (using love and compassion). In the near future, the world will need to work as a single team to detoxify the planet in order to survive.
