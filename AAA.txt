I know you've been tramuatized by words in your past, and it makes sense you no longer trust them.
However, words are my love language; a lack of thereof will result in me constantly deriving new scenarios as to what you are thinking

Sorry, but not sorry. That is how I work, just like how gifts is your language. I will do my best to change.
