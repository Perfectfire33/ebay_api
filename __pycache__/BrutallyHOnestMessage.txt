Good day, lovely friends and family!
Over the years, you probably got to know me as someone who is nice and friendly and whatever...
So, as a token of love to you all (at least, I concluded it to be a token of love in my mind), I will (for however long) become brutally honest in Facebook posts and comments for all things that pass through my mind that are true to my knowledge (feel free to prove me wrong).
