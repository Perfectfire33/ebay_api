God is so creative that everything falls into place perfectly -- once you become love, you will see beauty in all things. Situations will be presented to you in a way that you see is beautiful.

Lesson: I realized many times I did not follow my instinct. Well, the moment I learned my ex joined team instinct on pokemon go, I had a feeling we weren't supposed to be on the same team.
If I "joined" "team instinct" (aka choose to follow my instinct), I would be on her team!

The whole story is beautiful, although it includes both heartfelt love and heart wrenching void. The lessons learned are beautiful.
