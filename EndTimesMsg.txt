
Time for more than just a beer :(

From what I've concluded based on recent research, we are in for far worse than simply Yellowstone erupting. My final conclusion: I highly recommend leaving the country ASAP. 

I'm trying to wrap my head around the dots I've (and others that have brought massive amounts of data together) connected, and then I can find a way to explain to people. I will let you know when I get there. 

I believe the more open minded + conscious a person is, the less data will be needed to somehow break the cognitive dissonance they will experience. We'll have to take this into a secure chat.



I believe you, I'm just working on a way for other people to believe us :)




END OF AGE





I'm going to start working on a mind map to connect all the puzzle pieces together. Hopefully that will allow me to explain things from what info I've collected
