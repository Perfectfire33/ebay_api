2 reasons why people don't belong in houses:

1| You're typically not grounded indoors
2| Not too long ago (okay, maybe ~14 years lol) I would happily build teepees and wigwams and lay alongside bugs, dirt, and whatever else nature has around. I'd also garden, compost, be around a campfire, go swimming, or build snow fort. Now, I vaccuum dirt and relocate "nature" outside of my house. Bugs, dirt, and everything outdoors becomes an inconvience once inside long enough.
