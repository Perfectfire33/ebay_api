Yup, you are always right where you need to be, doing exactly what you need to be doing, feeling exactly what you need to be feeling :)
All is divinely written, thus everyone is playing their own role, doing exactly what they need to be doing to progress the game. Our team wins, and the Devil's team loses. Those who team with us will be moved out of harm's way, those who team with the Devil will be deceived. That's why even the elite will be deceived ;)


As the game comes to an end, it may be many player's turn to leave the game (players on both teams) as they need to play more games before they see the end of a game such as this one. So although there may be many massive disasters, it's all good.



Raise your vibration by loving yourself and all others--being charitable, providing service, having faith, and being patient to avoid disasters. Trust your instinct, ask for help, eat healthy (raw, whole foods--nuts, seeds, fruits, veggies, berries), listen to high vibration music, and remove toxins from your environment.
