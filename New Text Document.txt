Maybe around 1AM today Current Time = 3:30 AM 6/17/2020:

	*AT 26066 CLEAR ST. HARRISON TOWNSHIP MI 48045 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (Jim Harris hOUSE): An Animal (was dark and only saw for a moment) approx. 2' long x 1' tall (A Dog primarily taken care of by Anna?) may have from what seemed been tossed(?) out a window(?) and went running Jim Harris front yard into the street did not chase after 
(thought was a person rustling in bushes at first so started making noise at it)

Have not yet seen animal again (will go back out and keep eye on area soon)

	*26066 Jim Harris flash light 3 times side door light (signal to sue next door? w/ snow white cutout in fence)

	*Voice in head implied Jim Killed Anna . Heard this Around same time as animal sighting (1AM EST 6/17/2020)  do not remember if I heard voice before or after the animal rustling event distracted me

	*house next to 26066 (the one immediately to the left of 26066 CLEAR ST. HARRISON TOWNSHIP MI 48045 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (Jim Harris hOUSE) looking from bench in front at 26075 Clear St.) had a reflecting blue-ish light shining on it. Not sure what this is.

	*Had HTC Phone with Wi-Fi mac from earlier watching as well (Screen Side)

	*Maybe Jim was letting go of Anna's dog (odd to hear that much rustling out of nowhere and lights inside of Jim Harris house turn on / off a lot around this hour)?

If Voice in Head is correct, Is Jim considering Sucide?
