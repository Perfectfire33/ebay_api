PerfectfireIII thanks for taking the time with your feedback but God forbid I’m left behind let alone go to FEMA/ concentration camps. That’s a trap to force people to take the mark/chip or die which either way anyone left behind will have to physically die. But it most certainly would be for the Most High and not the AC. Been already prepared naturally and spiritually. But again thank you for your comment. Yahweh bless.


You're welcome!

One thing to note on 'either way anyone left behind will have to physically die':

The Lord has prepared a path to account for this as not having an option to survive makes no incentive for truly following Jesus in daily life (as our society does not allow for this).

It is not too late to prepare, but we are right on time (we are always right where we need to be)

History Repeats itself -- Now whole World is being Judged -- Whole World Flee This Time As There is a place to Go

Those who flee and make it to center of disc / top of world are 'rescued'
Physical healing of all sorts is likely to occur on the path to those who believe they will recieve and as it is written

Retaining Vehicle for Soul (human body) is Path for those who are set 'free' from the 'matrix'

Once Reality is Changed ('Christ Returns in You'), you are 'chipped', know you are not in 'control', and cannot die (I Already Tried), your purpose is told to you and you will fulfill it automatically (regardless of how much despair you are in)

Once Reality Changed, you are affected directly by Spiritual Warfare (A Demon Hunter)

Cigarettes, Energy Drinks, Flouride in Water, McDonalds, and Heavy Metal Music lower my vibrational frequency and life becomes more like hell
While marijuana, raw foods (nuts, seeds, berries, veggies), and high vibrational music increase my vibrational frequency and life becomes more like heaven

Must eliminate judgement of these 'tools'/'items' and use the ones that make sense to you at time of decision (left/right turns)

Can call it 'heaven on earth', but as we are in middle of warfare there is nothing peaceful about this
Must fight deception (sin) and discover truth and help others 'level up'. This will happen automatically as the game progresses

Physics are speeding up (magnetism going down, things manifesting quicker -- see Moore's Law ,, frequency going up (see earth resonance freq. since 1980s)

Higher earth frequency = higher level of concious awareness

Once You Begin Cleanse of Temple/Body/Vehicle, Numbers will Appear (See 'Angel Numbers')

This Member who is Speaking is close to being taken into the sky (visual experience, her reality will also be changed like 'twinking of eye')
It is likely she only has a few more 'right turns' to go


'right turn' -- an action that you take that you know in your heart is the right choice (intention is the key here)
'left turn' -- an action that you take out of fear (False Evidence Appearing Real)
See Ralph (Infinite Waters)

Thoughts --> Words --> Actions --> Habits --> Character --> Destiny

Those who seek truth will find it (a visual experience once pineal gland is cleansed)

Ask questions and believe you will receive hints in reality as time progresses to help answer them (angels are here to help)
When you feel you recieved a part of the answer, take notice of synchronicities

Concious awareness of Charity, Service, Faith, and Patience is key

May many miracles be upon us all!
