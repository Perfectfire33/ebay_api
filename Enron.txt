And then Watch "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room" (2005, 1h 49m, on Netflix) , it is a perfect example of what can be applied to society as a whole.


@ 47m: "An analyst asked a simple question in the article that no one could seem to answer: How exactly does Enron make its money?"

Now swap "Enron" for "<your favorite useless industry>" and "money" with "common good", and you can apply it directly to several industries.

E.g. "How exactly does the financial industry contribute to the common good?"


@1h - just like how Zeitgeist showed, real-life things are being affected by financial (imaginary) sources. Also, see planned obselence -- deliberately making things shitty so they break so you spend more money.

@1h 10m Milgram experiment is interesting as well.

@1h 18m "Enron is a house of cards"
The Federal Reserve Private Bank is also a house of cards (or, our global, truly anti-economic system).
