Sources for high quality herbs (from the back of the book):


For excellent high quality herbs, none better can be found than Ron Teeguarden's Dragonherbs and my freind George Lamoureaux at Jing Herbs. Desiree Ramero at Tonix Botanical Solutions has some excellent liquid extracts. These two were also apprentices to Ron Teeguarden. My friend and ancient comrade Baratunde in Atlanta is a top–notch herbal alchemist of the Taoist order, and of course, there's my own company, Shaman Shack.
