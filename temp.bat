I want to understand the IT world thoroughly so I can set up my own business and services if push comes to shove.

Hmm, I see... alrighty then! I'm going to break this down since there is a lot of data here.

Alright, I got all my class files syncing to my MTU Google Drive. It amounts to about 1 GB compressed. 
What is your email address that I should share this with?

Also, unfortunately, there are a lot of notes that had been written so I cannot share those easily. 
But I think the syllabi are a great place to start... follow those to get ideas of what to learn.

Hmm, this is a big idea but it is possible!
Here is my interpretation of what might need to be done to understand the IT world thoroughly:

|=>{"to understand the IT world thoroughly"};
^
|=>Summarize Meaning of IT world

               |>Understand the Purpose of Each Role         |>Identify IT World Components

                                                                        >Source0:"every SAT course";

Yes, setting up IT infrastructure and understanding how it works is critical to setting up a business.
