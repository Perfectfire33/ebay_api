Woah, you know that quote I made up earlier? "To truly understand the IT field is to understand life, for it is a reflection of who we are and what we can do." I just had a lightbulb light up in my head around 1h 39m 06s of this video I found earlier "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHCuSCUPXo0".
If there is no audio for you, I can give you a link to download it. Watch it from that time to at least 1h 42m 47s (where I happen to be at now at the time of sharing this  ). Crazy stuff, eh?
ALso, I swear I made up that quote before I watched this haha
