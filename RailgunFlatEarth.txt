The railgun has proved the earth is flat, and if u look into it, u will see that we can shoot a projectile up to 200 miles away without manipulating it at all to dip its nose and follow the curvature. It travels perfectly straight and connects 200 miles away WITHOUT ACCOUNTING FOR THE 120 FEET of curvature it should be correcting its path to follow! The final nail is in the coffin ballsacks! Its over, the globe cannot be accepted by ANY INTELLIGENT PERSON EVER AGAIN, NEVER EVER, UNLESS U ARE GETTING PAID TO PERPETUATE THE LIE!! That test was done by the military and it was written about in an article from 2010... Well befor the flat earth awareness was even gaining any followers, and so they overlooked the fuck up they were making and bragged about how big and bad the u.s.a is, and inadvertantly let everyone that can critically think know that the railgun shouldn't BE ABLE TO DO THAT IF THE EARTH WAS ROUND!!! Haha, please learn about it and spread the word people!!! The debate is a slam dunk for FLAT EARTH, the end of the age of deception is ending, and the rruth movement is here to pioneer the future of the world and its undiscovered lands and seas and creatures and Whatever else awaits us! Research railgun, and please, dont cry because u lost, it is better this way! The world just git a WHILE LOT BIGGER!!!!!?
