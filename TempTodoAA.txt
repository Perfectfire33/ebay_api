Goal: Employ this technology in order to buy time permaently and swiftly



Focus on process improvement (acquiring more time via optimizations) or focus on unlocking full potential (focus on buying time)?
Just buy time!
Mirror of rUnescape: 
We spent so much time leveling up, inching to high 70's in all skills available in free vversion, instead of spending that time focusing on unlocking the rest of the game (99% of the potential!!!) [i.e. get parents to buy runescape full edition!]

DO Quick Nutrition research, next weekend - -buy more superfoods / herbs for energy & well being & cleansing
THEN
	Apply consumption of additional resources; increase ovver time

Allocate ANother $500

Coibncidence itself is not coincidence.

Must continue to read
Must continue to write
Write thoughts -- Series of blogs
Connect Dots --> Series of documents
Write thoughts + facts --> series of articles?

Proof is as only as good as the person who believes it





We have a really good base camp here in Indy.
A place with a controlled enviornment, where we can learn.
And with this controlled environment, we may safely experiment with new ideas. One at a time. Observe carefully with no distractions.
Well, at least full control over our distractions.

I am now at a place where I may make extravagant and swift change.

We may mitigate all risks with the wisdom remembered and knowledge recovered during our time in Indy.





I stopped paying attention to the small little details after the decimal point
I stopped paying attention to the cupons
and the rewards programs
and other money-distracting(?) things
because that is extra brain cycles being expended
we use brain cycle conserving (like energy saving CPU technology)
THe idea of not wanting to waste money is good




H = S + C + V
Happiness = Set point in brain (attitude) + Financal Conditions of Living + Voluntary Choices Made Every Day
Focus on 4 intentions every day:
1) Joyful, energetic body
2) Lovivng, compassionate heart
3) Reflective, alert mind
4) Lightness of Being

ORGANIC Apple cider Vinegar --> Add to Water
 I usually suggest at least 2 teaspoons per 8 ounces. I encourage you to increase the amount once you have become more accustomed to the taste.

Protein 
>Active Adult @ 0.4 - 0.6 g per lb of body weight

140lbs -- 56-84g/day

if spirulina is 40% protein by weight;

1/2 tsp = ~2.1g * 0.4 = 0.84g protein per 1/2tsp

Make Some Tests --- Before and After, 6 months (now and Feburary??)


I suppose there exists an essential order of operations. To me, that would be first optimizing diet to a sustainable degree, and then





I suppose you generally want to follow a basic order of operations. Which, common sense dictates that a first goal to achieve would be to first realize maximum potential. So, that means providing the body with all the nutrients it can use.

Then, with maximum potential achieved, you can use that momentum to sustain itself over time, and 

I'll have to look those books up. I suppose there exists an essential order of operations. To me, that would be first optimizing diet to a sustainable degree (acquiring all usable nutrients each day), and then using that improved diet to do things you want to do.



I stopped drinking energy drinks because I realized I was beginning to think in ways that the caffeine and refined sugar would not allow. Think of it as a modern SSD (1000 MB/s) running in IDE UDMA-6 mode (133 MB/s), and how it would be bottlenecked. Just like IDE HDDs, energy drinks were the best solution for some time, and they worked great, until demand rose above what it could support. That's my view on the matter at least!



The "new science" (or new discoveries since 1984) that I have researched thus far support 

That means building a pool of recipes of all types in which I may select a few recipes each day.
