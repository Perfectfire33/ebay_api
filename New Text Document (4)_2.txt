26066 jim clear house all lights were off when I went back outside and then almost immediately turned back on. Heard a noise (loud clank?). Walked around the block, smelled gasoline near Lorie Nearnick(sp?) house which is behind 26066 jim clear house. Soon noticed gas tanker at Citgo filling up. Did not smell gas near that.

not sure how gas smell there and not at citgo. Did tanker know to go there at this time? Could any of what I think might be happening be happening?
