Okay. I see everyone circle jerking acting like this works. It doesn’t. I did it. 2 routing numbers. Search my name for previous comments.

Please pull heads out of asses and go right to the source. I’ve been on the phone with treasurydirect.gov

I wanted to know if they can tell me if i have any bonds in my name. Yes they can.

Fill out the form 1048 as best you can. Sign it at a bank. Mail it. They will open a case and search the archive.

In process. I’ll let you guys know what happens. 1 weeks time.

Reply if you are following me here. I won’t comment for nothing. Best,
